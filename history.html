        <h2 id="history-title">Our School's History</h2>
        <p id="history-para-1">According to the existing records of Polegoda
            Maha Vidyalaya, Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya was
            established in 1926. At the time of its establishment, there
            were eight students and three teachers, and the
            founding principal was <a href="#kularatne"> Mr.
                P.C.M.Kularatne</a>. He served as the principal for a
            long time.
            The founding student was Mr. Somapala Kularatne, Mr.
            P.C.M.Kularatne’s son. <br><br>

            It is mentioned in the book that our school was initially
            located in a house in the Kurunduwatte area and
            was brought to the current school site in 1929. Old records
            state that in 1929, a Sanghagatha Dakshina was
            established at the current Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya site, after
            which the school was started. Initially,
            three coconut frond sheds were used for teaching. <br><br>

            The first permanent building built here is the building where
            the media unit and the new Smart classroom are
            currently located (Mahasen Hall). The main hall was built in
            1972 and the other halls were built gradually
            in various years. <br><br>

            Among the principals who served in our school after Mr.
            Kularatne was a principal named <a href="#gunasena">Gunasena</a>. By the 60s, this school
            received a teachers' residence and the golden era
            of this
            school is considered to be the service period of Principal <a href="#abeyawardena">Abeyawardena</a>. During
            that period,
            the school's playground was prepared. Also, several buildings
            including the old laboratory and the home
            laboratory were constructed. It is said that a Lord named <a href="#chandaloka">Chandaloka</a> served as the
            Deputy
            Principal of this school. During that time, many buildings were
            constructed by holding fairs and screening
            films. <br><br>

            It is said that former Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike
            visited this school in 1952. Initially, this
            school was known as the <strong>South Mahagama
                Sucharithawardhana Swabhasha Mixed School</strong>. <br><br>

            In the 60s, it was a special event that a student from Polegoda
            Maha Vidyalaya was elected to the university
            for the first time. At that time, the Advanced Level classes
            were half-full, and in the late 70s, Advanced
            Level classes were resumed. Six other students entered the
            university at the same time in the late 70s.
            After Teacher Abhayawardhana left this school for another
            temple, Principal <a href="#ranathunga">Ranatunga</a> and
            then Principal <a href="#weerakoon">Weerakoon</a> served as
            acting principals. During that time, <a href="#amarasena">Mr. Amarasena</a> also served as a
            principal. In 1984, our school demonstrated an
            all-Ceylon level skill in
            throwing the hoop. <br><br>

            From 1986 to 96, Principal <a href="#anuradha">Anuradha
                Samaradiwakara</a> served in this school. Our
            school's Buddha Temple was built with the patronage of Mr.
            Calvin and the library building was built with
            the patronage of
            Mr. M.H. Piyasena. It is said that Mr. Ronnie De Mel, who was
            the Minister of Finance at that time, attended
            the opening of the library building. After Principal
            Samaradiwakara, <a href="#piyasena">Mr. Piyasena Jayananda</a>
            served as the principal for a while and then Principal <a href="#piyasoma">Piyasoma</a> also served here.
                    After him,
                    Principal <a href="#hemadasa">Hemadasa</a> passed away
                    while serving in this school. <br><br>

                    Later, Principal <a href="#gunasekara">Gunasekara</a>
                    served as the acting principal and then <a href="#siriyawathi">Mrs. Siriyawathi</a> served as
                    the acting principal. Principal <a href="#jayasiri">Jayasiri</a> came
                    to serve
                    in this school and served in this school until almost
                    2012. During that time, <strong>This school
                        became a Secondary School and the Primary School was
                        removed</strong>. The school also received
                    the Mahindodaya Laboratory during this period. <br><br>

                    From 2012, <a href="#jayapala">K. D. Jayapala</a> served
                            as the principal of this school until 2018.
                            During
                            that period, our school was also selected for
                            the Best School Nearest School project.
                            Several buildings were renovated by removing the
                            entrance hall and installing roofing
                            sheets. The school received two new teachers'
                            houses and the old teachers' house was also
                            renovated. <br><br>

                            Principal <a href="#saman">Saman Rohana
                                Karunaratne</a> served as the principal of
                            this
                            school
                            from 2018 to 2024. Several buildings were
                            renovated during the same period. In 2019, ten
                            students enrolled in the university from this
                            school. <br><br>

                            The current Principal, <a href="#duleeka">Mrs.
                                W.D.D.M. Premathilaka</a>, will assume the
                            position
                            of Principal from 14th February 2024.

                'history-para-1': `According to the existing records of Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya, Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya was established in 1926. At the time of its establishment, there were eight students and three teachers, and the founding principal was <a href="#kularatne"> Mr. P.C.M.Kularatne</a>. He served as the principal for a long time. The founding student was Mr. Somapala Kularatne, Mr. P.C.M.Kularatne's son. <br><br>

It is mentioned in the book that our school was initially located in a house in the Kurunduwatte area and was brought to the current school site in 1929. Old records state that in 1929, a Sanghagatha Dakshina was established at the current Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya site, after which the school was started. Initially, three coconut frond sheds were used for teaching. <br><br>

The first permanent building built here is the building where the media unit and the new Smart classroom are currently located (Mahasen Hall). The main hall was built in 1972 and the other halls were built gradually in various years. <br><br>

Among the principals who served in our school after Mr. Kularatne was a principal named <a href="#gunasena">Gunasena</a>. By the 60s, this school received a teachers' residence and the golden era of this school is considered to be the service period of Principal <a href="#abeyawardena">Abeyawardena</a>. During that period, the school's playground was prepared. Also, several buildings including the old laboratory and the home laboratory were constructed. It is said that a Lord named <a href="#chandaloka">Chandaloka</a> served as the Deputy Principal of this school. During that time, many buildings were constructed by holding fairs and screening films. <br><br>

It is said that former Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike visited this school in 1952. Initially, this school was known as the <strong>South Mahagama Sucharithawardhana Swabhasha Mixed School</strong>. <br><br>

In the 60s, it was a special event that a student from Polegoda Maha Vidyalaya was elected to the university for the first time. At that time, the Advanced Level classes were half-full, and in the late 70s, Advanced Level classes were resumed. Six other students entered the university at the same time in the late 70s. After Teacher Abhayawardhana left this school for another temple, Principal <a href="#ranathunga">Ranatunga</a> and then Principal <a href="#weerakoon">Weerakoon</a> served as acting principals. During that time, <a href="#amarasena">Mr. Amarasena</a> also served as a principal. In 1984, our school demonstrated an all-Ceylon level skill in throwing the hoop. <br><br>

From 1986 to 96, Principal <a href="#anuradha">Anuradha Samaradiwakara</a> served in this school. Our school's Buddha Temple was built with the patronage of Mr. Calvin and the library building was built with the patronage of Mr. M.H. Piyasena. It is said that Mr. Ronnie De Mel, who was the Minister of Finance at that time, attended the opening of the library building. After Principal Samaradiwakara, <a href="#piyasena">Mr. Piyasena Jayananda</a> served as the principal for a while and then Principal <a href="#piyasoma">Piyasoma</a> also served here. After him, Principal <a href="#hemadasa">Hemadasa</a> passed away while serving in this school. <br><br>

Later, Principal <a href="#gunasekara">Gunasekara</a> served as the acting principal and then <a href="#siriyawathi">Mrs. Siriyawathi</a> served as the acting principal. Principal <a href="#jayasiri">Jayasiri</a> came to serve in this school and served in this school until almost 2012. During that <strong>time, this school became a secondary school and the primary school was removed</strong>. The school also received the Mahindodaya Laboratory during this period. <br><br>

From 2012, <a href="#jayapala">K. D. Jayapala</a> served as the principal of this school until 2018. During that period, our school was also selected for the Best School Nearest School project. Several buildings were renovated by removing the entrance hall and installing roofing sheets. The school received two new teachers' houses and the old teachers' house was also renovated. <br><br>

Principal <a href="#saman">Saman Rohana Karunaratne</a> served as the principal of this school from 2018 to 2024. Several buildings were renovated during the same period. In 2019, ten students enrolled in the university from this school. <br><br>

The current Principal, <a href="#duleeka">Mrs. W.D.D.M. Premathilaka</a>, will assume the position of Principal from 14th February 2024.`,

දෙනෙකු සහ ගුරුවරුන් තිදෙනෙකු සිටි අතර, ආරම්භක විදුහල්පතිවරයා <a href="#kularatne">පී.සී.එම්.කුලරත්න</a> මහතා විය. ඔහු
දිගු කලක් විදුහල්පති ලෙස සේවය කළේය. ආරම්භක ශිෂ්‍යයා පී.සී.එම්.කුලරත්න මහතාගේ පුත් සෝමපාල කුලරත්න මහතා ය. <br><br>

අපගේ පාසල මුලින් කුරුඳුවත්ත ප්‍රදේශයේ නිවසක පිහිටා තිබූ බවත් 1929 දී වත්මන් පාසල් භූමියට ගෙන එන ලද බවත් පොතේ සඳහන් වේ.
පැරණි වාර්තාවල සඳහන් වන්නේ 1929 දී වත්මන් පොලේගොඩ මහා විද්‍යාල භූමියේ සංඝගත දක්ෂිණාවක් සිදුකර, පසුව පාසල
ආරම්භ කරන ලද බවත්ය. මුලදී, ඉගැන්වීම සඳහා පොල් අතු මඩු තුනක් භාවිතා කරන ලදී. <br><br>

මෙහි ඉදිකරන ලද පළමු ස්ථිර ගොඩනැගිල්ල වන්නේ මාධ්‍ය ඒකකය සහ නව ස්මාර්ට් පන්ති කාමරය දැනට පිහිටා ඇති ගොඩනැගිල්ලයි (මහසෙන්
ශාලාව). ප්‍රධාන ශාලාව 1972 දී ඉදිකරන ලද අතර අනෙකුත් ශාලා විවිධ වසරවලදී ක්‍රමයෙන් ඉදිකරන ලදී. <br><br>

කුලරත්න මහතාගෙන් පසු අපගේ පාසලේ සේවය කළ විදුහල්පතිවරුන් අතර <a href="#gunasena">ගුණසේන</a> නම් විදුහල්පතිවරයෙක් සිටියේය.
60 දශකය වන විට මෙම පාසලට ගුරු නිවසක් ලැබුණු අතර මෙම පාසලේ ස්වර්ණමය යුගය විදුහල්පති <a href="#abeyawardena">අබේවර්ධන</a>
මහතාගේ සේවා කාලය ලෙස සැලකේ. එම කාලය තුළ පාසලේ ක්‍රීඩා පිටිය සකස් කරන ලදී. එසේම පැරණි රසායනාගාරය සහ ගෘහ රසායනාගාරය ඇතුළු
ගොඩනැගිලි කිහිපයක් ඉදිකරන ලදී. මෙම පාසලේ නියෝජ්‍ය විදුහල්පතිවරයා ලෙස <a href="#chandaloka">ඡන්දාලෝක</a> නම් ස්වාමීන්
වහන්සේ සේවය කළ බව කියනු ලැබේ. එම කාලය තුළ පොළවල් පවත්වා චිත්‍රපට ප්‍රදර්ශනය කිරීමෙන් බොහෝ ගොඩනැගිලි ඉදිකරන ලදී. <br><br>

1952 දී හිටපු අගමැති එස්.ඩබ්ලිව්.ආර්.ඩී. බණ්ඩාරනායක මහතා මෙම පාසලට පැමිණි බව කියනු ලැබේ. මුලදී, මෙම පාසල <strong>දකුණු මහගම
සුචරිතවර්ධන ස්වභාෂා මිශ්‍ර පාසල</strong> ලෙස හැඳින්විණි. <br><br>

60 දශකයේ දී, පොලේගොඩ මහා විද්‍යාලයෙන් ශිෂ්‍යයෙකු පළමු වරට විශ්ව විද්‍යාලයට තේරී පත්වීම විශේෂ සිදුවීමක් විය. ඒ කාලයේදී
උසස් පෙළ පන්ති අඩක් පිරී තිබූ අතර 70 දශකයේ අගභාගයේදී උසස් පෙළ පන්ති නැවත ආරම්භ කරන ලදී. 70 දශකයේ අගභාගයේදී තවත් සිසුන්
හය දෙනෙකු විශ්වවිද්‍යාලයට ඇතුළත් විය. විදුහල්පති අභයවර්ධන මහතා මෙම පාසලෙන් ඉවත් වී වෙනත් පන්සලකට ගිය පසු, විදුහල්පති <a href="#ranathunga">රණතුංග</a> සහ
පසුව විදුහල්පති <a href="#weerakoon">වීරකෝන්</a> වැඩබලන විදුහල්පතිවරුන් ලෙස සේවය කළහ. එම කාලය තුළ <a href="#amarasena">අමරසේන</a> මහතා
විදුහල්පතිවරයෙකු ලෙසද සේවය කළේය. 1984 දී, අපගේ පාසලේ සමස්ත ලංකා මට්ටමේ කුසලතාවයක් පෙන්නුම් කළේය. <br><br>

1986 සිට 96 දක්වා, විදුහල්පති <a href="#anuradha">අනුරාධ සමරදිවාකර</a> මෙම පාසලේ සේවය කළේය. අපගේ පාසලේ බුද්ධ මන්දිරය

සමරදිවාකර මහතාගෙන් පසු, <a  href="#piyasena">පියසේන ජයනන්ද</a> මහතා ටික කලක් විදුහල්පති ලෙස සේවය කළ අතර පසුව විදුහල්පති <a
    href="#piyasoma">පියසෝම</a> මහතා ද මෙහි සේවය කළේය. ඔහුගෙන් පසු, මෙම පාසලේ සේවය කරමින් සිටියදී විදුහල්පති <a href="#hemadasa">හේමදාස</a> මහතා අභාවප්‍රාප්ත විය. <br><br>
